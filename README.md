# Employee Leave Management System (Frontend)

A React-based frontend for managing employee leave requests, employee profiles, and departments. This project integrates with a backend API that provides data such as departments, leave types, and employee leave records.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - A React component library for faster and easier web development.
- **Formik** - A popular React form library to manage form state and validation.
- **Yup** - A validation library that integrates well with Formik.
- **React Query** - A library for fetching, caching, and syncing server state in React.
- **React Router** - For managing navigation in a single-page application.
- **Axios** - For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and better development experience.
- **JWT** - JSON Web Token for handling user authentication.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 📦 Install Dependencies

To install all the required dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
````

### 💻 Run Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 🔐 Environment Variables

This project uses JWT tokens stored in `localStorage` for authentication. You should ensure that your backend API is set up to accept JWT tokens in requests.

---

## 🧪 Testing

For testing the frontend:

* Use **React DevTools** to inspect the React component tree.
* Use **Network** tab in Chrome DevTools to monitor API requests and responses.

---

## 🔒 Authentication

* After login, the JWT token is stored in `localStorage` under the respective client role (either `admin` or `employee`).
* Protected routes will redirect to the login page if the user is not authenticated.
* JWT tokens are included in the headers of API requests using **Axios**.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### API Integration

API requests are handled by the **APIClient** service in the `services/` folder. Each module (departments, employees, leaves) uses `React Query` hooks to fetch data asynchronously from the backend.

### Router Configuration

React Router is used to handle routing. Protected routes are set up to only allow access to certain paths for authenticated users.

Lazy loading is enabled using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` to load components only when needed, improving the app's performance.
